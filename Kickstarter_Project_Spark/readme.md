## Introduction
This project leveraged the [Kickstarter dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects), focusing on campaign projects, to develop and evaluate various classifier models for predicting the success of crowdfunding campaigns. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the aim was to create robust predictive models capable of discerning factors contributing to the success or failure of Kickstarter campaigns. The project involved preprocessing and analyzing the dataset, feature engineering, and implementing different classification algorithms to identify patterns and trends associated with campaign outcomes. The ultimate goal was to provide insights and predictive tools to assist campaign creators and backers in making informed decisions about the potential success of Kickstarter projects.

## Files
This folder contains a full report .pdf file, a presentation .pdf where you can find a summary of the project's findings, and a folder with the code used to develop the project
The Code folder contains the following files:
  * notebooks from 1 to 5 covering from data preparation to data explorations,
  * notebooks 6 to 9 covering the different trained classifiers,
  * notebook 10 that covers the standardization of the data and a linear regressor model,
  * the original dataset ks-projects-201801 downloaded from Kaggle, and
  * the dataset kickstarter_cleaned obtained after the cleaning and preprocessing of the original dataset. At the end of the Data Preparation notebook you can find the line of code to download the processed dataset.

## Dependencies
* Jupyter notebook
* PySpark
* MLlib library

## Course Content
